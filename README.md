# Members-only

Members-only is an exclusive clubhouse website where its members can write posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

This project is focused on authentication and authorization. The authentication used in this app is created from scratch with the help of [bycrypt gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/bcrypt/versions/3.1.12).

Created as part of The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication?ref=lnav#project-2-members-only
